                <p> This service is designed for early risers who want to be at various work places before 8:00am but do not have
                     the time and convenience of space to bring their vehicle for service during official hours.
                  All that is required is for customers to book an appointment (appointment desk line 01-794-9496)
                     ahead of time and bring their vehicle for routine service as early as 6:30am (Mondays-Fridays). We 
                  have the process in place to deliver our customersâ€™ vehicles to them at or before 8:00am so they
                      could meet their early official engagements and or appointments.</p>
